        <div id="para1">
            <p>While India celebrates the successful landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the moon, there are only a few who are talking about the female scientists who worked behind the scenes to make the mission successful.</p>
            <p>India's Chandrayaan-3 has triumphantly achieved a precise touchdown on the southern pole of the moon, thereby elevating India to the esteemed position of the fourth nation globally, following the United States, China, and the former Soviet Union, to successfully execute this remarkable accomplishment. The commencement of this mission transpired from Sriharikota on the 14th of July.</p>
            <p>On August 26, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with several female scientists from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to highlight the role women played in Chandrayaan-3 lunar mission. “The women scientists of this mission have played a crucial role in ensuring its success. Without their contribution, this achievement was just not possible. They will inspire generations to come,” Modi said.</p>
            <p>Modi also decided to name Chandrayaan-3’s landing spot on the moon “Shiv Shakti”, a name derived from the concept of feminine energy in Hindu mythology, and a tribute to the women scientists who worked on the mission. Between 20 and 25 per cent of the space agency’s over 16,000 employees are women.</p>
            <p>Over 100 women scientists and engineers are reported to have been involved in the mission, which culminated in India landing its lunar rover on August 23 and becoming the first country to put a spacecraft near the moon’s south pole. Many women were in the control room at the time of the launch and during the landing on August 23.</p>
            <p>In an interview with DW, ISRO chief S. Somanath talked about how women were involved in conceptualizing, designing and executing the Chandrayaan-3 mission. “Some of them played a significant role in navigation during the lander’s critical descent,” said Somanath.</p>

            <h1 id="fact1_heading">Fact 1: Pioneering the Lunar South Pole</h1>
            <p>Chandrayaan-3 made history by becoming the first mission to achieve a soft landing on the Moon's south pole. This previously unexplored region holds great scientific interest due to the presence of water ice trapped in permanently shadowed craters. Scientists believe this ice could be a valuable resource for future lunar exploration and potentially even support the establishment of a sustainable human presence on the Moon.</p>
        </span>
        <span id="fact2">
            <h1 id="fact2_heading">Fact 2: A Short but Historic Journey</h1>
            <p>While Chandrayaan-3's landing was a success, the mission on the lunar surface had a predetermined duration. The lander wasn't equipped to endure the extreme cold of the lunar night.  As planned, the mission concluded twelve days after landing when the landing site plunged into darkness. Despite the short operational lifespan, the data collected by Chandrayaan-3 during its lunar day provided valuable insights into the south pole's composition and environment, paving the way for future lunar exploration missions.</p>
